description: Review the changes since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes — Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating spec asked for?). Runs both axes in one sub-agent and reports them side by side.

Two-axis review of the diff between `HEAD` and a fixed point the user supplies:

- **Standards** — does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec** — does the code faithfully implement the originating spec?

One **sub-agent** reads the diff once and reviews it twice, one pass per axis, so the review stays out of this context and neither axis bleeds into the other. This skill then reports both passes.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point

Whatever the user said is the fixed point — a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc. If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...HEAD` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..HEAD --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point resolves (`git rev-parse <fixed-point>`) and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here — not inside the sub-agent.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. A path the user passed as an argument.
2. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
3. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the Spec pass will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below — a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation — and, like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name** — a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code** — the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy** — a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps** — the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession** — a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches** — the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery** — one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change** — one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality** — abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains** — long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man** — a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest** — a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Spawn the review sub-agent

One sub-agent, one prompt. Include:

- The diff command and the commit list.
- The standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3 pasted in full** — the sub-agent has no other access to it.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec, or the words "no spec available".

The brief:

> Read the diff once, then review it twice — one pass per axis, in order. Each pass sees only its own sources; carry no finding from one pass into the other, and rank findings only within the pass that raised them.
>
> **Pass 1 — Standards.** Sources: the standards files and the smell baseline. Report — per file/hunk where relevant — (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls — documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Write it out under `## Standards`, under 400 words.
>
> **Pass 2 — Spec.** Source: the spec. Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Write it out under `## Spec`, under 400 words. Given "no spec available", write `## Spec — no spec available` and stop there.
>
> Return the two sections and nothing else — no summary, no cross-axis comparison.

### 5. Aggregate

Print the sub-agent's two sections verbatim or lightly cleaned, under their `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings. Do **not** merge or rerank findings — the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). This summary is yours, not the sub-agent's — it's the one cross-axis operation, and the sub-agent was told to keep the axes apart. Don't pick a single winner across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other. With both passes inside one sub-agent, that separation rests on the brief rather than on process isolation — which is why the brief spells out the no-carry, no-cross-rank rule, and why the summary line stays with this skill.
